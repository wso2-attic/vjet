	<h1>Debugging your programs </h1>
	<p>In this section, you will learn how to debug a VJET program. </p>
	
	<ol>
  	  <li>Please make sure the VJET file <em>MyTest.js</em> is opened in your editor area.</li>
      
      <li>
        Place your cursor on the vertical ruler along the left edge of the editor
    	area on the following line in the main() method: 
    	<p><code>var size = x.length;</code></p>
    	<p>and double-click on the ruler to set a breakpoint.</p>
    	<p><img src="../images/bTutorial/debug1.gif"  alt="MyTest.js editor showing added breakpoint"></p>
    	The breakpoint icon indicates the status of the breakpoint. The plain
    	blue breakpoint icon indicates that the breakpoint has been set, but not yet
    	installed.
  	  </li>
  	  
  	  <li>
  	    From Script Explorer view, select <em>MyTest.js</em> file, <b>Right click</b> on it.
  	    <br>From context menu, select <b>Debug As</b> &gt; <b>VJET JS Application</b>.
        <p><em>Note: the Debug As context menu is also available in other places.</em></p>
  	  </li>
  	  
  	  <li>
    	You can also simply hit the debug button <img src="../images/bTutorial/vjo_debug_button.png" alt="Debug button"> 
        which will launch the currently selected resource or active editor.
      </li>
  	  
  	  <li>
  	    The program will run until the breakpoint is reached.
  	    When the breakpoint is hit, execution is suspended, and you will reach the Debug perspective. 
    	<p>Notice that the process is still active (not terminated) in the Debug view. Other threads might still be running.
    	<p><img src="../images/bTutorial/debug2.gif"  alt="Debug perspective"></p>
  	  </li>
  	  
  	  <li>
  	    In the editor in the Debug perspective, select <code>x.length</code> from the line above
    	where the breakpoint is set, and from its context menu, select <b>Inspect</b>. 
    	<p><img src="../images/bTutorial/debug3.gif"  alt="Test.js editor with selected breakpoint line showing context menu"></p>
  	  </li>
  	
  	  <li>
  	    The expression is evaluated in the context of the current stack frame, and a pop-up appears which displays the results. You can send a result to
    	the Expressions view by pressing the key binding displayed in the pop-up.
    	<p><img src="../images/bTutorial/vjo_editor_test_inspect_value.png"  alt="Test.js inspect pop-up with value"></p>
  	  </li>
  	  
  	  <li>
  	    Expressions that you evaluate while debugging a program will be listed in this view. 
  	    To delete an expression after working with it, select the expression and choose <b>Remove</b> from its context menu. 
  	  </li>
  	  
  	  <li>
  	    The Variables view (available on a tab along with the Expressions view) displays the values of the variables in the selected stack frame. 
  	    Expand the <code>x.length</code> tree in the Variables view until you can see elementCount.
  	  </li>
  	  
  	  <li>
  	    The variables (e.g., size) in the Variables view will change when you step through Test in the Debug view.&nbsp;
  	    To step through the code, click the <b>Step Over</b> (<img src="../../images/org.eclipse.debug.ui/elcl16/stepover_co.png" alt="Step Over" >) button.&nbsp;
        (Or <kbd>F6</kbd> as a shortcut). Execution will continue at the next line in the same method (or, if you are at the end of a method, it will continue in the method from which the current method was called).
    	<p><img src="../images/bTutorial/vjo_view_variables_1.png"  alt="Variables view"></p>
  	  </li>
  	  
  	  <!--
  	  <li>
  	    In the variables view you can choose to see certain types as logical structures. 
  	    This hides the implementation details of a type and simply shows it as arrays or fields. 
  	    You can define logical structures by yourself in the preference page <b>VJO &gt; Debug &gt; Logical Structures</b>
   	    <font color="red">Not yet implemented</font>).
  		<p><img src="../images/bTutorial/vjo_view_variables_logical_structures.png" alt="fFull shown as logical structure"></p>
  	  </li>
      -->
    
  	  <li> 
  	    Try some other step buttons 
    	(<b>Step Into</b> <img src="../../images/org.eclipse.debug.ui/elcl16/stepinto_co.png" alt="Step Into" >, 
    	<b>Step Return</b> <img src="../../images/org.eclipse.debug.ui/elcl16/stepreturn_co.png" alt="Step Return" >)to
    	step through the code.&nbsp; Note the differences in stepping techniques.
    	Select the <strong>Use Step Filters </strong> command [ <img src="../../images/org.eclipse.debug.ui/elcl16/stepbystep_co.png" alt="Use Step Filters"> ] to change whether step filters should be used in the <a href="../../../org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/views/debug/ref-debug_view.htm"><strong>Debug View</strong></a>.
    	Step filters are commonly used to filter out types that you do not wish to see or step through while debugging.
    	<br/>For example, if you did not want to the see or step through anything from the URI pattern <em><strong>test.Test.*</strong></em>, you would add this to the list of filtered URIs. 
    	<br/>Adding URIs to the list of those to be filtered can be done via the <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.ebayopensource.vjet.eclipse.preferences.debug.stepfiltering)")'> <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.png" alt="Opens the Step Filtering preference page"> <strong>VJET &gt; Debug &gt; Step Filtering</strong></a> preference page.  
  	  </li>

	  <li>
	  You can end a debugging session by allowing the program to run to completion or by terminating it.
      <ul type = "square">
        <li>
          You can continue to step over the code with the <b>Step </b>buttons until the program completes.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can click the&nbsp; <strong>Resume </strong>  
      	  (<img src="../../images/org.eclipse.debug.ui/elcl16/resume_co.png" alt="Resume" >) button to allow the
          program to run until the next breakpoint is encountered or until the program is completed.
        </li>
      	<li>
      	  You can select <b>Terminate</b> from the context menu of the program's process in the Debug view to terminate the program.
      	</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
