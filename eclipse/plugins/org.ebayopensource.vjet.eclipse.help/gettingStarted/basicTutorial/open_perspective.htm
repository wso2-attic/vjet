    <p>VJET features are available in the VJET perspectives.  VJET provides 2 perspectives</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>VJET JS Perspective - This perspective is designed for those working at the VJET project level and consists of the 
    		Script Explorer (displays the list of VJET projects) and the editor.
    	<li>VJET JS Browsing Perspective - This perspective is designed for those who wish to browse the <i>structure</i> of the VJET projects.
    		This perspective includes a detailed Projects view, Packages view, Types view, and Members view, in addition to the editor.</li>
